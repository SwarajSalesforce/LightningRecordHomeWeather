# LightningRecordHomeWeather
Lightning Component to bring the weather from Weather Underground API to a record home layout

This code is part 2 of a 2 part blog on CRMScience.com Lab Coat Lessons

The code uses an Apex utility class to retrieve weather information and a Lightning Component to present it on the record home view.

An additional Lightning App ("TEST") is included to show an easier and faster way to debug Lightning Components intended for the record home view.
